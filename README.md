# Visual-Studio-Code-Customization
Over a long period of time, I needed lots of modifications, I changed the look, features, extensions as well as theme. No theme is perfect for my personalization, so I customized a theme in my way. Also, I like to customize extension features. So every time why I set up a new work environment I need to do it manually.
